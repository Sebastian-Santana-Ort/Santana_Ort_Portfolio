# Portfolio of Sebastian Santana Ortiz

## About
I am an analyst with ample experience in the academic and public sectors. Currently, I am a Master's student in the Population and Public Health (MSc) program at the University of British Columbia. I completed two honors thesis in the last year of my BA(Hons) in Psychology at the University of Victoria. At the Canadian Institute for Substance Use Research, I applied a multinomial multivariate logistic regression to assess the risk of unintentional and intentional injury attributable to cannabis exposure. At the Institute on Aging & Lifelong Health, I used multilevel modelling to understand the relationship between social determinants of health and cognitive functioning in persons with dementia and their caregivers. 

I am interested in the real-life applications of data for system-wide decision-making. I have analyzed projects across multiple levels of government (regional, provincial, and federal). I have learned how to operate multiple statistical tools (R, Python, SQL, Excel, SPSS, SAS, and MPlus). My previous work expands a vast array of topics (e.g., police reform, technology adoption, cognitive psychology, education, transportation, substance use policy, and social determinants of health).

## Public Sector Projects

Because of constraints regarding confidentiality, I am not able to disclose in full the contents of my analysis while working as a policy analyst in the public sector. Still, I wanted to describe the work that I did and provide limited extracts of the work I undertook.
